                             We focus on the process of stimulating Science in a class 
                             environment. <br> involve the stakeholders of a successful lesson;
                             the learner and the teacher.

                    <h3>Electronics</h3>
                    <p>
                       In an ordinary African classroom lesson, this branch of Physics looks so abstract and no wonder some curriculum developers have suggested it should not be introduced until someone has specialised in Physics at an advanced level. However, we prove that electronics concepts can easily be mastered by first stimulating a learner through practical electronics applied in building a robot.              
                    </p>

                    <h3>Mechanics</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is one of the science concepts applied in a robot build up. It is a branch of Physics which learners find difficulty understanding from plain classroom lessons. At Fundi Bots, the journey of a robot equips a learner with practical mechanics even before they know it!

                    <h3>Computer Programming</h3>
                    <p>
                        In order to give a sense of behaviour to a robot, one needs the knowledge of computer programming. This, at the end of the process, produces learners who are not only computer literate, but are also able to use computer knowledge to create solutions for the problems in their communities.
